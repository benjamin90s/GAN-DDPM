# GAN-DDPM
This project involves training a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) on the CIFAR-10 dataset and a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) on the Animal Faces (AFHQ) dataset.

For running the notebook, Execute the cells in sequence from top to bottom by pressing Shift + Enter on each cell or by using the "Run All" feature in the Jupyter interface.
DC-GAN runtime: ~ 1 hour.
DDPM runtime: ~ 10 hours.
